-------------------
CampusMapDataReader.java: It converts the csv file into a useable list of destinations given a file reader

Edge.java: This class allows people to implement the edge functionality for the project so we could have edges leaving in the desitnations

CampusMapDataReaderInterface.java: is an interface that was the backbone of CampusMapDataReader.java

Destinations.java: gives an instance of destinations they have a name and edges that leave them. making them the vertexs on the map 

DestinationsInterface.java: is an interface that is the back bone of Destinations.java

DataWangglerTests.java: Provides Junit test to make sure the project is running smoothly

Madisonmap.csv: spent time compiling all of the street data within our given area and made all of the intersections adn loactions verticies and paths streets
